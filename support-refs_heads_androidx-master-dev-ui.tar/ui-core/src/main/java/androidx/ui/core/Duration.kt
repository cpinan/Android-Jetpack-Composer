/**
 * A span of time, such as 27 days, 4 hours, 12 minutes, and 3 seconds.
 *
 * A [Duration] represents a difference from one point in time to another. The
 * duration may be "negative" if the difference is from a later time to an
 * earlier.
 *
 * Durations are context independent. For example, a duration of 2 days is
 * always 48 hours, even when it is added to a `DateTime` just when the
 * time zone is about to do a daylight-savings switch.
 *
 * Despite the same name, a [Duration] object does not implement "Durations"
 * as specified by ISO 8601. In particular, a duration object does not keep
 * track of the individually provided members (such as "days" or "hours"), but
 * only uses these arguments to compute the length of the corresponding time
 * interval.
 *
 * To create a [Duration], use the unit extension functions on the primitive
 * `Int` and `Long` types:
 *
 *     val aLongWeekend = 96.hours
 *
 * To create a [Duration] from several components, use the [Duration] factory function:
 *
 *     val fastestMarathon = Duration(hours = 2, minutes = 3, seconds = 2)
 *
 * The [Duration] is the sum of all individual parts.
 * This means that individual parts can be larger than the next-bigger unit.
 * For example, [inMinutes] can be greater than 59.
 *
 *     assertEquals(123, fastestMarathon.inMinutes)
 *
 * All individual parts are allowed to be negative.
 *
 * Use one of the extensions such as [inDays] to retrieve the integer value of the Duration
 * in the specified time unit. Note that the returned value is rounded down.
 * For example,
 *
 *     val aLongWeekend = 86.hours
 *     assertEquals(3, aLongWeekend.inDays())
