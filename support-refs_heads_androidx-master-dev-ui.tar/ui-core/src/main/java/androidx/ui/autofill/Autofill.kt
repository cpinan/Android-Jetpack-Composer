 * autofill, and it holds the [onFill] lambda which is called by the autofill framework.
 *
 * @property autofillTypes A list of autofill types for this node. These types are conveyed to the
 * autofill framework and it is used to call [onFill] with the appropriate value. If you don't set
 * this property, the autofill framework will use heuristics to guess the type. This property is a
 * list because some fields can have multiple types. For instance, userid in a login form can
 * either be a username or an email address. TODO(b/138731416): Check with the autofill service
 * team if the order matters, and how duplicate types are handled.
 *
 * @property boundingBox The screen coordinates of the composable being autofilled.
 * This data is used by the autofill framework to decide where to show the autofill popup.
 *
 * @property onFill The callback that is called by the autofill framework to perform autofill.
 *
 * @property id A virtual id that is automatically generated for each node.
