/**
 * Algorithms to use when painting on the canvas.
 *
 * When drawing a shape or image onto a canvas, different algorithms can be
 * used to blend the pixels. The different values of [BlendMode] specify
 * different such algorithms.
 *
 * Each algorithm has two inputs, the _source_, which is the image being drawn,
 * and the _destination_, which is the image into which the source image is
 * being composited. The destination is often thought of as the _background_.
 * The source and destination both have four color channels, the red, green,
 * blue, and alpha channels. These are typically represented as numbers in the
 * range 0.0 to 1.0. The output of the algorithm also has these same four
 * channels, with values computed from the source and destination.
 *
 * The documentation of each value below describes how the algorithm works. In
 * each case, an image shows the output of blending a source image with a
 * destination image. In the images below, the destination is represented by an
 * image with horizontal lines and an opaque landscape photograph, and the
 * source is represented by an image with vertical lines (the same lines but
 * rotated) and a bird clip-art image. The [src] mode shows only the source
 * image, and the [dst] mode shows only the destination image. In the
 * documentation below, the transparency is illustrated by a checkerboard
 * pattern. The [clear] mode drops both the source and destination, resulting
 * in an output that is entirely transparent (illustrated by a solid
 * checkerboard pattern).
 *
 * The horizontal and vertical bars in these images show the red, green, and
 * blue channels with varying opacity levels, then all three color channels
 * together with those same varying opacity levels, then all three color
 * channels set to zero with those varying opacity levels, then two bars showing
 * a red/green/blue repeating gradient, the first with full opacity and the
 * second with partial opacity, and finally a bar with the three color channels
 * set to zero but the opacity varying in a repeating gradient.
 *
 * ## Application to the [Canvas] API
 *
 * When using [Canvas.saveLayer] and [Canvas.restore], the blend mode of the
 * [Paint] given to the [Canvas.saveLayer] will be applied when
 * [Canvas.restore] is called. Each call to [Canvas.saveLayer] introduces a new
 * layer onto which shapes and images are painted; when [Canvas.restore] is
 * called, that layer is then composited onto the parent layer, with the source
 * being the most-recently-drawn shapes and images, and the destination being
 * the parent layer. (For the first [Canvas.saveLayer] call, the parent layer
 * is the canvas itself.)
 *
 * See also:
 *
 *  * [Paint.blendMode], which uses [BlendMode] to define the compositing
 *    strategy.
