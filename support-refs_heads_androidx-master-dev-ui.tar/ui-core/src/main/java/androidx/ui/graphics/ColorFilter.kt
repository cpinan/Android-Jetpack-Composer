 * A description of a color filter to apply when drawing a shape or compositing
 * a layer with a particular [Paint]. A color filter is a function that takes
 * two colors, and outputs one color. When applied during compositing, it is
 * independently applied to each pixel of the layer being drawn before the
 * entire layer is merged with the destination.
 *
 * Instances of this class are used with [Paint.colorFilter] on [Paint]
 * objects.

 * The output of this filter is then composited into the background according
 * to the [Paint.blendMode], using the output of this filter as the source
