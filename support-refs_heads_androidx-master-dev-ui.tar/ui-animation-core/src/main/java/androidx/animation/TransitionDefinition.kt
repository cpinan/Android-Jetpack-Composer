/**
 * Static specification for the transition from one state to another.
 *
 * Each property involved in the states that the transition is from and to can have an animation
 * associated with it. When such an animation is defined, the animation system will be using it
 * instead of the default [Physics] animation to createAnimation the value change for that property.
 *
 * The following sample code will create a [TransitionSpec] that defines animations for 3
 * properties: `radius`, `alpha`, and `background`.
 * ```
 *  transition(fromState = ButtonState.Released, toState = ButtonState.Pressed) {
 *      radius using tween {
 *          easing = LinearEasing
 *          duration = 75
 *      }
 *      alpha using keyframes {
 *          duration = 375
 *          0f at 0 // ms  // Optional
 *          0.4f at 75 // ms
 *          0.4f at 225 // ms
 *          0f at 375 // ms  // Optional
 *      }
 *      background using physics {
 *          dampingRatio = 1.0f
