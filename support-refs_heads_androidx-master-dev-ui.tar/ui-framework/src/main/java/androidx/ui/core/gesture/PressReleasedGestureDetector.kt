/**
 * This gesture detector fires a callback when a traditional press is being released.  This is
 * generally the same thing as "onTap" or "onClick".
 *
 * More specifically, it will call [onRelease] if:
 * - All of the first [PointerInputChange]s it receives during the [PointerEventPass.PostUp] pass
 *   have unconsumed down changes, thus representing new set of pointers, none of which have had
 *   their down events consumed.
 * - The last [PointerInputChange] it receives during the [PointerEventPass.PostUp] pass has
 *   an unconsumed up change.
 * - While it has at least one pointer touching it, no [PointerInputChange] has had any
 *   movement consumed (as that would indicate that something in the heirarchy moved and this a
 *   press should be cancelled.
 *
 * By default, this gesture detector also consumes the down change during the
 * [PointerEventPass.PostUp] pass if it has not already been consumed. That behavior can be changed
 * via [consumeDownOnStart].
